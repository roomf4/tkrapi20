# README.md

This repo, tkrapi20, should contain demos for a Meetup:

2017-08-24

Stock Market ML API with Flask-RESTful AND Keras-Tensor-Flow

https://www.meetup.com/BAyPIGgies/events/239118816/

https://www.meetup.com/Palo-Alto-Data-Science-Association/events/242451739/

The software in this repo was developed on Ubuntu 16.

If you want to run the demos on your laptop, you should install Ubuntu 16 on your laptop.

If you are on Mac or windows, a straightforward way to do this is to install VirtualBox.

After you install VirtualBox, download the file listed below and then import it into VirtualBox.

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx3iDDAtxxI4VUtZcTRxTnZKZlk/

It is a large 10GB file.

After you import the above file, you should use the green-arrow in the VirtualBox GUI to boot Ubuntu 16.

After you boot Ubuntu 16, you should see a login screen for an account named: 'ann'.

The password is: 'a'

After I did the above steps, I logged in as 'ann' with password 'a'.

Next, I cloned this repo using a simple shell command:

```bash
cd ~ann
git clone https://github.com/danbikle/tkrapi20
```

I ran the first demo by issuing some shell commands:

```bash
cd ~ann
cd tkrapi20
. env.bash
python
```

I saw in the Python banner that I was running this:

```bash
ann@ub16aug:~/tkrapi20$ python
Python 3.6.1 |Anaconda 4.4.0 (64-bit)| (default, May 11 2017, 13:09:58) 
[GCC 4.4.7 20120313 (Red Hat 4.4.7-1)] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> quit()
ann@ub16aug:~/tkrapi20$
```

The next demo I ran was a single shell command which is listed below:

```bash
conda install flask keras numpy pandas psycopg2 sqlalchemy
```

The above command finished after 90 seconds.

Next, I ran this shell command:

```bash
conda install flask-restful -c conda-forge
```

Then, I checked that the above packages were installed with shell commands:

```bash
conda list flask
conda list keras
conda list numpy
conda list pandas
conda list psycopg2
conda list sqlalchemy
```

Next, I worked with Postgres so this repo could interact with database tables.

I issued some shell commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-server-dev-all libpq-dev
sudo su - postgres
psql
```

At this point I was inside the psql interface which accepts both Postgres and SQL commands.

I typed three commands:

```sql
create database tkrapi;
create role tkrapi with login superuser password 'tkrapi';
\q
```

I typed exit at the shell prompt to exit the postgres Linux account and return to the ann account:

```bash
exit
```

In the py folder of this repo, I wrote some demos of packages:

* SQLAlchemy
* Keras
* FlaskRESTful

The shell commands for the first demo are listed below:

```bash
cd ~/tkrapi20/py
. ../env.bash
~/anaconda3/bin/python demosql.py
```

The above demo worked well so I stepped through the script with the pdb-debugger:

```bash
~/anaconda3/bin/python -m pdb demosql.py
```

The above demo worked well so I pointed demosql.py at a Postgres database on Heroku:

```bash
cd ~/tkrapi20/py
heroku create myapp2017abc
heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
heroku config
export PGURL='postgres://afizipm:33abc8@ec2-23-13-220-251.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/ddrpugf'
~/anaconda3/bin/python demosql.py
heroku pg:psql
select * from dropme;
\q
unset PGURL
```

The above demo worked well so I ran some shell commands to start the Keras demo:

```bash
cd ~/tkrapi20/py
. ../env.bash
~/anaconda3/bin/python demokeras.py
```

The above demo worked well so I stepped through the script with the pdb-debugger:

```bash
~/anaconda3/bin/python -m pdb demokeras.py
```

The above demo worked well so I ran some shell commands to start the FlaskRESTful demo:

```bash
cd ~/tkrapi20/py
. ../env.bash
export PORT=5050
export FLASK_DEBUG=1
~/anaconda3/bin/python demoflask_restful.py
```

The above shell became locked. I call it Shell-1.

I started another shell, called Shell-2, and issued curl commands:

```bash
curl                            localhost:5050/hello.json
curl -d 'msg2flask=hello-flask' localhost:5050/hello.json
```

I saw this:

```bash
ann@ub16aug:~/tkrapi20/py$ curl http://0.0.0.0:5050/hello.json
{
    "hello": "world"
}
ann@ub16aug:~/tkrapi20/py$ 
ann@ub16aug:~/tkrapi20/py$ 
ann@ub16aug:~/tkrapi20/py$ 



ann@ub16aug:~/tkrapi20/py$ curl -d 'msg2flask=hello-flask' localhost:5050/hello.json
{
    "post-hello": "world",
    "curlmsg": "hello-flask"
}
ann@ub16aug:~/tkrapi20/py$ 
ann@ub16aug:~/tkrapi20/py$ 
ann@ub16aug:~/tkrapi20/py$ 
```

When I study the behavior of the above curl commands, I see that the get() method in demoflask_restful.py responds to the first curl command.

And I see that the post() method responds to the second.

These methods get() and post() correspond to HTTP verbs: GET, POST.

https://www.google.com/search?q=what+are+HTTP+verbs

So, that concludes the discussion about the three demos.

We have a sense of how the Python APIs work for SQLAlchemy, Keras, and FlaskRESTful.

Later we will blend the above three APIs into a simple API server.

But first we need to get some data.

# Get Data

I used shell commands listed below to get stock price data:

```bash
cd ~/tkrapi20
bin/request_tkr.bash
```

While the above command was running, I captured a partial screen shot:

```bash

The above script needs between 5 and 6 hours to run.

I ran it on my laptop; after it finished I checked the disk usage:

```bash
ann@ub16aug:~/tkrapi20$ du -sh ~/tkrcsv/*
2.9M	/home/ann/tkrcsv/div
255M	/home/ann/tkrcsv/history
2.9M	/home/ann/tkrcsv/split
ann@ub16aug:~/tkrapi20$ 
ann@ub16aug:~/tkrapi20$ 
```

The above script depends on tkrlist.txt, a list of 728 tickers, to declare which stocks to get.

If I am in a hurry, I update the script so it uses tkrlist_small.txt which lists these tickers:

```bash

The script bin/request_tkr.bash, depends on py/request_tkr.py which depends on the Python requests package:

http://docs.python-requests.org

If you study request_tkr.py you will see it sends an initial request to a URL like this:

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/IBM

Yahoo responds to that request with two pieces of information I need to track.

The first piece is in a browser cookie.

The second piece, I call it a crumb, is embedded within the HTML response from Yahoo.

The next request goes to a url like this:

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/IBM/history?p=IBM

Then, another request goes to a url like this:

https://query1.finance.yahoo.com/v7/finance/download/IBM?period1=-631123200&period2=1503561650&interval=1d&events=div&crumb=UCaZNLyqkGQ

Notice the crumb parameter at the end.

The Python script request_tkr.py figures out what that crumb should be by using a regexp search against a previous Yahoo HTML response.

If I send the wrong crumb (a crumb which fails to match my cookie), Yahoo responds with this friendly message:

```json
{
    "finance": {
        "error": {
            "code": "Unauthorized",
            "description": "Invalid cookie"
        }
    }
}
```

That is the only 'tricky' part of the script; the rest is plain-old web-scraping.

When Yahoo sees the above request, it usually responds with a CSV file after it matches the crumb with the cookie it had served me earlier.

I'm not sure why Yahoo is serving crumbs and cookies which frequently change but I thought that solving the puzzle was fun.

After the above script finishes, I run another script to copy all the CSV data into a Postgres table.

That script is named: csv2db.py

I should run csv2db.py after request_tkr.bash finishes.

The shell commands to run csv2db.py are listed below:

```bash
cd ~/tkrapi20
. env.bash
bin/rmbad_cookies.bash
~/anaconda3/bin/python py/csv2db.py
```

I ran the above script on my laptop and it finished in about 30 seconds.

The script rmbad_cookies.bash removes CSV files which contain error messages from Yahoo rather than good data.

After I run csv2db.py, I am ready to generate machine learning features from dates and prices of each ticker.

# Generate Features

When I started working with stock market data many years ago I quickly saw that other people making decisions based on trendlines and candlesticks.

Also I saw some people making decisions based on what I call 'calendar events'.

For example some people like to sell in May and buy in October.

Or maybe they want to buy on Monday and sell on Friday.

I saw this behavior and used it to guide my efforts to create machine learning features from time series of prices.

The features I use in this repo are listed below:

* pct_lag1 (1 day pct pricelag)
* pct_lag2
* pct_lag4
* pct_lag8
* slope3 (normalized 3 day price moving avg slope)
* slope4
* slope5
* slope6
* slope7
* slope8
* slope9
* dow (integer day of week)
* moy (integer month of year)

Counting them up, we see that this repo has 13 features.

One feature I don't have but would like is daily interest rate.

The script which generates the above features from the CSV files is genf.py

The shell command to run genf.py is listed below

```bash
cd ~/tkrapi20/py
. ../env.bash
~/anaconda3/bin/python genf.py
```

I ran the above script on my laptop and it finished after 5 minutes.
I used the Postgres psql command to see the features inside the features table:

```sql

ann@ub16aug:~/tkrapi20$ bin/psql.bash

# Learn, Predict

After the features are ready, I can learn and predict from them.

A demonstration of the Python API which supports both Learn and Predict is listed below:

```python
cd ~/tkrapi20
~/anaconda3/bin/python
import kerastkr
kerastkr.learn_predict_kerasnn('^GSPC',25,'2017-08')
```

The above syntax should predict one-day percent gain, a variable I call: 'pct_lead', for each day in the month 2017-08.

The predictions are for a ticker called: '^GSPC' which tracks the S&P 500 index.

The Keras model which calculates the predictions learns from 25 years of ^GSPC features (created from dates and prices).

I ran the above syntax on my laptop and captured a screenshot:

```python
ann@ub16aug:~$

The above tabular report is output from a Pandas DataFrame.

In a middle column I see the predictions from my Keras model.

In this example all of the predictions are above zero so they are bullish predictions.

The most bullish prediction was issued for 2017-08-10.

When I look to the right of that prediction I see it was an accurate predicition.

I consider any prediction which can predict the sign of pct_lead, to be an accurate prediction.

Lets attach this Python syntax to a FlaskRESTful API server.

# FlaskRESTful

I use the syntax below to start the FlaskRESTful API server:

```bash
cd ~/tkrapi20
./flaskr.bash
```

I ran the above syntax on my laptop and captured a screenshot:

```bash
ann@ub16aug:~/tkrapi20$ 
ann@ub16aug:~/tkrapi20$ ./flaskr.bash 
Using TensorFlow backend.
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5011/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with stat
Using TensorFlow backend.
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 167-686-399
```

So, that shell became locked.

I started another shell and issued a simple curl command.

I captured a screenshot:

```json
ann@ub16aug:~/tkrapi20$ curl localhost:5011/demos
{
    "demos": [
        "/demos",

Also I noticed that FlaskRESTful added a line to its shell:

```bash

127.0.0.1 - - [24/Aug/2017 14:51:54] "GET /demos HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

The above output tells me that FlaskRESTful saw a GET request for /demos and the response code was 200 which usually means good news.

Remember above that I had asked for a month of predictions using Python syntax:

```python
kerastkr.learn_predict_kerasnn('^GSPC',25,'2017-08')
```

I sent a similar request to FlaskRESTful using curl and captured a screenshot:

After I ran the above curl command I summarized the output:

* sklinear is much faster than keras_nn
* The above model was less bullish (bearish prediction on 2017-08-18)
* The bearish prediction on 2017-08-18 was True but not very effective.

# Keras + Postgres

Next, I ran a demo which saves a keras model into a Postgres table which holds predictions for each month.

Then, I captured a screenshot:

If we have time in the Meetup we will step through the above code in the debugger.

The ability to store Keras models in a database is an attractive feature.

It allows me to generate models on a cluster of cheap or free hardware.

Then, I can deploy the models to an API server so they can be used by many users.

Also, technology exists which allows me to convert the models into a format suitable for running in a browser:

https://github.com/transcranial/keras-js

Perhaps a demo of some details behind this theme would make a good Meetup presentation in the future.

If you have questions, e-me: bikle101 at gmail

If you want to wrestle with this technology in a classroom environment I invite you to attend my classes at Santa Clara Adult Education.

They are easy to find with google or send me an e-mail.

I look forward to working with you on your Machine Learning Applications/Projects.
